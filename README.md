# ATM-Simulation
atm- simulation project based on python.
 ATM Simulation in Python | CLI-Based Project
This is a simple ATM Simulation system built using Python, designed for beginners to practice basic programming concepts. It runs in the terminal and allows a user to log in using a username and 4-digit PIN, then perform banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system. The project uses fundamental logic including if-else statements, while loops, and input validation, making it a great starting point for Python learners
